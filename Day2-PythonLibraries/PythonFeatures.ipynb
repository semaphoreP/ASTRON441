    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented language, meaning that *everything* (even basic types like `int`s and `str`s) are represented as objects (more details coming up). Here are some built-in types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int`: integers (no decimals). Example: 345\n",
    "- `str`: series of characters (words). Example: \"Hello World\"\n",
    "- `float`: numeric value with decimals. Example: 1.234, 1e-234, 1.0\n",
    "- `bool`: True or False. Example: True\n",
    "- `list`: a series of items linked together. Example: [1, \"Hello\", 2, 3.4]\n",
    "- `tuple`: lists that cannot be changed. Example: (1, \"Hello\", 2, 3.4)\n",
    "- `dict`: a series of key->value mappings. Example: {1: \"Hi\", \"test\": 2.3, 3: \"World\"}"

The implication is that if you set one variable equation to another, it makes a *copy* of the value to store in the second variable. I generally find this to be the more intuitive behavior."
