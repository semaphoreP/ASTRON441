    "Generally, it is important to focus your effort on speeding up the 1 or 2 slowest functions. If you speed up something that takes 50% of the runtime by a factor of 2, you speed up the code by a factor of 25%. If a piece of code takes 10% of the runtime, a factor of 2 improvement (which by itself is often hard to get) only gives you a 5% improvement in the end. **Focus your effort on optimizing the runtime of the one or two functions that take the most amount of time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For all else, it is generally more important to optimize code readibility over runtime. Code that is more readible is less prone to bugs and eaiser to maintain. If a piece of code takes only 0.0001% of the runtime, any amount of speed up is not worth making the code hard to read (from a person-hour perspective). Many times, it is difficult to gain more than a factor of 2 speed up in runtime. Definitely think about the potential gain in speed-up versus how long it takes to write and maintian the code.\n",

    "If you identified the critical chunk of code to speed up, the general strategy is to remove unncessary computations as much as possible. There's unfortunately not one single method to speed up your code. But here are a few ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Eliminate computations that are not being used (e.g., computing variables you do not use; processing parts of images that will be discarded). \n",
    "2. Use `numpy` functions whenever possible for matrix operations\n",
    "3. Avoid using python `for` and `while` loops as they are slow\n",
    "4. If MKL/BLAS is being run inside of already-parallelized code, disable MKL/BLAS (see parallelization materials for more details on MKL/BLAS).\n",
    "5. Reduce the number of iterations or increase the tolerance of routines that are unncessarily precise (e.g., optimizers can run for less iterations; sin and cos can be approximated by taylor expansions). \n",
    "6. Avoid copying variables when they do not need to be copied (e.g., if the input is already a numpy.array, you don't need to wrap it with `np.array()` in ensure it's a numpy array). \n",

    "## Code Performance Extrapolation\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code takes 24 hours to run to completion, or needs to be run on a cluster, it is likely still easier to develop and benchmark it on your laptop. We can use extrapolation to estimate performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally algorithm runtimes scale as N^a where a is some positive number greater than 1, and N is the size of your data. (In CS terms, this is often disccused in \"Big O\" notation as  $O(N^a)$ runtime). If your data is too big or takes too long to benchmark on a single machine, try running your code on much smaller data. If you do this for ~3-5 different test data with different N, you can estimate what is the scaling of your code (i.e., what is \"a\"). Once you know the scaling you can use that scaling relation to extrapolate how long it will take on larger datasets. If you can also use more cores, you can divide the final runtime by the number of cores you can use. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example (very idealized), my code takes 1 second on 10x10 data, 100 seconds on 100x100 data, and 400 seconds on 200x200 data (all on a single core). My code scales as N^2 where N is the size of one dimension of the data. If I want to run it on 10000x10000 data with 100 cores, my code should take (10000^2)/100 = 1,000,000 seconds to run. In practice there will probably be some deviations to these estimates (due to overheads, CPU usage scheudling, other factors), but this scaling should give you a general sense of how long something will take. \n",

If you have an array of 1000x1000 floats, then it will take up 8e6 bytes or 8 MBs. If you have 3-D numerical data with dimensions 1000x1000x1000, then it will take up 8e9 bytes or 8 GBs."
